// relationship to the scroll, so at an ordinary wheel speed every element began
// well below the fold and finished above the top of the screen, and whatever the
// reader caught was an arbitrary phase of it that then snapped to done. A
// `view()` timeline makes progress a function of position instead, so the
// element is always in the state its place on screen calls for.
//
// This module is the fallback for browsers without those timelines, playing the
// same two gestures off a timer. Both paths test the same way, so nothing can
// animate twice. The stylesheet's half lives in `globals.css` under
// "band entrances".
